The Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) from Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD)  are proprietary and, as such, are not publicly shareable. Instead, we have uploaded a small section of CIFs, which are used for this study.

Our methodology is compatible with open-source databases such as the Materials Project and Crystallography Open Database, which also contain CIF files.
